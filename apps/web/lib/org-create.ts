 * Next.js treats EVERY export from a `"use server"` module as a publicly
 * invokable server action — a route reachable from any client that obtains
 * its action ID, with no session check beyond what the function performs
 * itself. This function takes `userId` as a parameter, so exporting it from
 * a "use server" module exposed an unauthenticated endpoint that any caller
 * could use to create owner-organizations for arbitrary user IDs (e.g. to
 * grief victims by exhausting their MAX_OWNED_ORGS_PER_USER cap).
 *
 * Keeping it in a plain server lib makes it importable from server-side
 * code (Server Components, server actions, route handlers) without being
 * routable on its own.

/**
 * Deferred welcome grant — call after repositories are connected to an org

 * Bitbucket OAuth callback). Releases the bonus for users whose grant was
 * skipped at org creation because they have no OAuth credential (magic-link
 * signups): connecting a repo is the product signal a signup farm doesn't
 * produce. Do NOT call it from client-asserted repo-creation paths (CLI local
 * indexing, token-driven action/OSS review payloads) — a farmed API token
 * could self-grant through those.
 *
 * Only orgs marked WELCOME_DEFERRED_REASON at creation can release: legacy
 * orgs (pre-stamp owners with welcomeGrantedAt=NULL, never backfilled) don't
 * carry the marker, so they can't mint a retroactive bonus. A Bitbucket
 * workspace or GitLab namespace already attached to ANOTHER org doesn't
 * count as a product signal either — one bought forge account must not
 * release grants for unlimited farmed orgs (GitHub needs no such check:
 * Organization.githubInstallationId is unique).
 *
 * Idempotent: the once-per-user welcomeGrantedAt claim (updateMany where null)
 * means multiple repos, retries, and concurrent connects grant at most once.
 * A hold/block risk band still withholds — and consumes the claim — exactly
 * like the org-creation path. Never throws: a grant failure must not break a
 * repo connect.
