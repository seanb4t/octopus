/**
 * Heuristic diff classification + model tier resolution in front of
 * getReviewModel. Trivial/mechanical diffs (lockfile bumps, generated files,
 * docs/tests-only, tiny single-file edits) downshift to a cheaper model; the
 * default (Sonnet) is used for everything else. A deeper model for
 * complex/high-risk diffs is deferred to a plan-gated follow-up — this only ever
 * LOWERS cost, never risks quality by downshifting a substantive change.
 *
 * classifyDiff is pure/deterministic (unit-tested). resolveReviewModel keeps the
 * existing precedence (explicit override / repo pin / org pin win first) and is
 * self-protecting: it never emits a model that has no pricing (which would bill
 * $0), falling back to the default instead.
