Your default stance is skepticism: for each finding, actively try to REFUTE it using the diff and the provided context. A finding survives with high confidence ONLY if you cannot refute it and can point to the concrete evidence that proves it. Assign a confidence score (0-100); a finding you can refute, or cannot tie to concrete evidence, gets a LOW score.

FINDINGS:
${findingsSummary}

DIFF:
\`\`\`diff
${diffWindow}
\`\`\`${crossFileSection}${fileTreeSection}

Scoring guide:
- 90-100: Issue is directly visible in the diff with near-certainty
- 70-89: Issue is clearly supported by the diff and context
- 50-69: Issue is inferred from patterns, likely but not certain
- 20-49: Issue is speculative or weakly supported
- 0-19: False positive — not supported by the diff at all

When a finding claims a function call has wrong parameters, a missing import, or a type mismatch:
- Check the "Referenced Code Context" section if available for the actual definition
- If the context confirms the usage is correct, assign confidence 10-20
- If the context confirms the issue, keep or raise confidence

When a finding flags a "broad" operation (regex, string replacement, deletion) as over-aggressive:
- Check whether the input is already constrained by prior code (capture groups, filters, conditionals)
- If the input is pre-scoped so the broad operation is intentionally exhaustive, assign confidence 10-20

When a finding is based on a general heuristic ("don't replace all X", "avoid broad regex") rather than a concrete traced bug:
- If no specific incorrect behavior is demonstrated, assign confidence 30-50

When the diff includes comments explaining the domain-specific reason for an approach and the finding contradicts that without concrete counter-evidence:
- Assign confidence 10-20

CRITICAL — VERIFICATION CONTEXT:
Some findings include a ">> VERIFICATION CONTEXT" section with actual code from the repository (fetched from the vector database). This is ground truth from the indexed codebase. Use it to verify or disprove the finding's claims:
- If a finding claims "missing import for X" but the verification context shows the import already exists in the same file, assign confidence 0-10 — it is a false positive
- If a finding claims "missing function call" but the verification context shows the function is already called, assign confidence 0-10
- If a finding claims "inconsistent pattern" but the verification context shows the pattern difference is due to different call-site architectures (both achieving the same result), assign confidence 0-10
- Lines marked [SAME FILE] are from the finding's own file — these are the strongest evidence for or against the claim
- If verification context CONFIRMS the issue (e.g., the import truly does not exist), keep or raise confidence

EXISTENCE / "MISSING X" FINDINGS (route not registered, handler/export/import missing, file not found):
- These were checked against the ACTUAL file, not just the diff. Look for a ">> SYMBOL ... FOUND" or ">> SYMBOL ... NOT FOUND" line, or a "[SAME FILE — FULL FILE SEARCHED]" block, in the verification context.
- If the symbol was FOUND in the file, the thing EXISTS — assign confidence 0-10 (false positive), even if it is not visible in the diff window above. The diff is only a window; the file is the ground truth.
- If the verification context says "FETCH FAILED" or the symbol could not be checked, you CANNOT verify absence — assign confidence ≤20. Never confirm a "missing" claim you were unable to verify against the file.
- Never raise confidence on a "missing X" finding solely because X is absent from the (possibly truncated) diff window.
- If the file path appears in the REPOSITORY FILE TREE, never confirm a "file does not exist / missing file" finding for it.

When a finding claims something is "missing" from a new function (missing DB save, missing auth, missing cleanup):
- Check if the function is called from a larger handler visible in the diff — the caller may already do it
- If the diff shows a function being invoked within a handler that performs the "missing" step earlier, assign confidence 10-20

When a finding flags a pattern as problematic (polling, unencrypted storage, streaming approach):
- Check if the SAME pattern already exists elsewhere in the diff or Referenced Code Context
- If an identical pattern is used nearby in the same file or project, assign confidence 10-20 — the new code is following established conventions

When a finding flags code duplication or DRY violations:
- If the two code paths serve different purposes, handle different concerns, or are likely to diverge, assign confidence 10-20
- Only keep duplication findings (confidence 50+) when the code is truly identical, serves the same purpose, and would clearly benefit from abstraction

When a finding flags a literal number as a "magic number" or "not configurable":
- If it is a cosmetic UX value (delays, timing), a one-time operational constant, or a trivial threshold used in a single place, assign confidence 10-20
- Only keep magic number findings when the value appears multiple times or has non-obvious domain significance

When a finding flags storage/column size concerns:
- If the column type is TEXT, JSONB, or similar unbounded type, assign confidence 10-20
- Only keep size findings when there is evidence the column has a restrictive type (VARCHAR with small limit)

For each finding, respond with ONLY a JSON array. For a finding you KEEP (high
confidence), include a one-line "citation" with the concrete diff location
(\`file:Lnn\`) that proves it. For a finding you REFUTE or doubt (low confidence),
include a short "refutation" saying why:
[{"index": 0, "confidence": 92, "citation": "src/db.ts:L42"}, {"index": 1, "confidence": 15, "refutation": "the null guard already exists 3 lines above"}, ...]
